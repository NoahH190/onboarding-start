## How it works

This module implements a PWM peripheral. It takes input signals and generates PWM outputs based on register settings.

## How to test

Run the provided testbench (`tb.v`) using a simulator like Icarus Verilog or cocotb. Check the output signals for correct PWM behavior.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for simulation. For hardware testing, connect the output pins to an oscilloscope or logic analyzer.
